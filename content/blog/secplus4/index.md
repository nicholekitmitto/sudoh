## Welcome back!

This is the fourth post in my Security+ Study Guide Notes! In this post we'll be talking about a few different types of attacks and how to secure your network against them.

`Note: These posts are in no means meant to be bite-sized content, these will be as detailed and long as I can reasonably make them without writing a whole post on each objective`
